# 6.036 Homework and Notes

This is a repo that I'll use to save the homeworks, exercies, and some random stuff for MIT's 6.036, found here: https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/about


Note that I save these files as PDFs since it takes a literal eternity to copy these into KaTeX/Markdown
